## Example Problem

- We are going to input 2 features, _Hours Spent Studying_ and _Number Of Lectures_ to be able to predict $ \hat{y} $ will the person pass a class.
- _'Y-hat'_ refers to:
<ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-top: -0.5rem;">
<li> y typically represents the actual observed value or the target variable.</li>
<li> y-hat ($\hat{y}$) represents the model's prediction for that target variable, based on the input features.</li>
</ul >
